The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
Jackdaws love my big sphinx of quartz.
The five boxing wizards jump quickly.
How razorback-jumping frogs can level six piqued gymnasts!
Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs.

Sphinx of black quartz, judge my vow.
The job requires extra pluck and zeal from every young wage earner.
Grumpy wizards make toxic brew for the evil Queen and Jack.
Few quips galvanized the mock jury box.
